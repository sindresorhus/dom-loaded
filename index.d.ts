Check when the DOM has loaded like [`DOMContentLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded). Unlike `DOMContentLoaded`, this also works when included after the DOM was loaded.

The promise resolves when the DOM finishes loading or right away if the DOM has already loaded.

@example
```
import domLoaded from 'dom-loaded';

await domLoaded;
console.log('The DOM is now loaded.');
